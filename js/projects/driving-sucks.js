        <p>Driving Sucks is a project that I created to shed light on the negative impacts of
            driving, both on the driver as well as on the community.</p>
        <p>The narrative animates based on the users scroll position and first provides some
            arguments against driving before providing some alternatives.</p>
        <p>At the end there is a tool that utilizes an API called Targomo to show how far a user can
            travel by foot, bike, or bus within a given timeframe. The point of this tool is to
            reveal the distance the user can go without a car in a relatively small amount of time.
