    <div class="project-description">
        <p>I built this simple help queue app using Google Firebase as a real time backend. The inspiration for this project came from my frustrations as a Teaching Assistant with keeping track of who needed help in what order. I decided to solve this with a web app to ensure I could help students on a first come, first served basis. It worked out pretty well and greatly decreased my stress in class and students appreciated a clear system for asking questions.</p>
