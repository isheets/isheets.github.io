    <div class="project-description">
        <p>Throughout the Spring 2019 semester I worked with a team of two other students to research, design, and user test a new user experience for the CU Syllabus Archive for our client Jacie Moriyama, CU Student Services Portfolio Manager</p>
        <p>My team's consoltation was necessary because the university wanted to provide a more valuable experience to students and faculty looking to view past syllabi for various courses.</p>
        <p>We began our design process by analyzing the Syllabus Archive system that was currently in place and determining what changes would be useful. After this we created an initial prototype of the system in Adobe XD.</p>
        <p>After prototyping, we interviewed a variety of CU faculty and students to get feedback on our design so that we could fine tune it to the needs of potential users.</p>
        <p>We repeated the process of prototyping and user testing several times until we felt that our design addressed all the needs of the users and accomplished the initial design considerations we were provided with at the start of the project.</p>
        <p>To finish the project, we distilled our findings into a design report and recorded a video demonstrating our XD prototype and delivered these to our client.</p>
