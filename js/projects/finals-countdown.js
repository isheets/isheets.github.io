        <p>The Finals Countdown is a React web app that I developed with team of three. The
            inspiration behind the product the desire to compartmentalize and prioritize studying
            based on how soon a final exam will be for a given course. </p>
        <p>Users can input when their final exam will be and then add specific to-do items to each
            final. Our app then begins a countdown to the finals so that the user can keep track of
            what studying should be done first.</p>
        <p>We used Firebase to persist the user's data and the application was built entirely with
            reusable React components. Our team used GitHub for version control and collaboration,
            and adhered to the Agile development process to increase efficiency.</p>
