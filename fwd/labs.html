					<h3>lab 3</h3>
					<p class = "description">Lab 3 is an exercise in jQuery. The task was to create a basic webpage that uses jQuery to select, filter, and manipulate elements on the page in at least three ways. I chose to explore using element tags and IDs to select, and odd/even filter. I manipulated text in a div and toggled classes for elements via jQuery. I animated the "top" attribute of my container div to move everything down the page on button press. </p>

The user enters their address and they can see how far they can get in 10, 20, or 30 minutes using one of three transporation options. The page also gets the weather and displays it so that the user can make an informed choice about the transportation method they choose</p>
